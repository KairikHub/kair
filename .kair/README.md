# Embedded Kair Runtime

This directory stores the repo-embedded Kair runtime payload so Kair can run on host macOS machines without requiring a host Node/npm install.

Primary command path:

```bash
./.kair/bin/kair --help
```

Rebuild/update this payload:

```bash
./scripts/package-kair-runtime.sh
```
